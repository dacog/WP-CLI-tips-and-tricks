wp-cli is a super useful shell tool.

wp search-replace 'www.storystudiochicago.com' 'www.storystudiochicago.org' --skip-columns=guid
wp search-replace 'storystudiochicago.com' 'storystudiochicago.org' --skip-columns=guid
wp search-replace 'example.dev' 'example.com' --skip-columns=guid
Or, if you only want to change the option, you can do:

wp option update home 'http://example.com'
wp option update siteurl 'http://example.com'

wp rewrite structure  (permalinks)
==

wp option get permalink_structure

wp option update permalink_structure '/%postname%'

=====
Purging Cache
In this example, object caching is enabled on the site on our Managed WordPress or Managed WooCommerce, if you need to clear the object cache, use:

wp cache flush

Regenerate Thumbnail Images
If you changed the theme you were using on your site (which might be setting different image sizes), or if you changed the product image sizes in WooCommerce but now need to regenerate all thumbnail images, you can run this command:

wp media regenerate --yes

Deleting Spam Comments
If you have comments enabled on your site and you want to delete all spam comments. Only run this command if you know that you do have comments marked as spam on your site, then you can run this command:

wp comment delete $(wp comment list --status=spam --format=ids)

Removing Temp Data from Database
Expired transients can build up if you have a WooCommerce store. If you need to delete any of this temporary data, you can remove it from your database by running the following command:

wp transient delete --expired

Optimizing a Database
If you want to optimize your site database, you can run this command:

wp db optimize

Deleting Posts in Trash
If you wanted to delete all posts that are in the trash, only run this command if you have moved posts to the trash, then you could run this command:

wp post delete $(wp post list --post_status=trash --format=ids)

Deleting Posts in Draft Status
If you did need to delete all posts that are set as draft post status, you could run this command;

wp post delete $(wp post list --post_status=draft --format=ids)

wp db export

You can now use gzip to compress the resulting sql file which will mean a smaller file being stored on your server:

gzip sitebackup.sql

Cleaning Up Your Post Revisions
To delete post all revisions (moving them temporarily into the trash), use this WP-CLI command:

wp post delete $(wp post list --post_type='revision' --format=ids)

To delete the post revisions which have been moved to the trash (this includes all post revisions which have a post status of trash), run this command:


wp post delete --force $(wp post list --post_type='revision' --format=ids)


You can skip the first step of moving the posts to the trash by just running the second command. This will remove all post revisions, both those in the trash and those that are in the active portion of the site.

wp post delete $(wp post list --post_type='revision' --format=ids)

 

These WP-CLI commands are all very handy for basic housekeeping of your site. These commands in WP-CLI can be used daily or weekly to keep your site optimized and free of bloat.


====
To install the package for WP-CLI, run the following command:

wp package install trepmal/wp-revisions-cli

After the package WP Revisions has been installed, to clean all post revisions, you can use the following command. Please note: this command can be slow, since it will query post revisions before deleting them.

wp revisions clean -1

If you wanted to delete all post revisions before a specific date, you can include that in the command. For example:

wp revisions clean --before-date=2019-06-10

If you needed to clean all post revisions other than those for a specific post type, include that post type at the end of the command. For example, revisions for the WooCommerce created product post type would not be deleted if you run this command:

wp revisions clean --post_type=product

For a faster method to delete all post revisions, you can run this command:

wp revisions dump --hard

To list all existing post revisions, you can run this command:

wp revisions list

Easily deleting post revisions from your site database will help keep the database cleaned up. Streamlining the database can result in performance improvements, especially as the size of the database grows.

The wp-sec package is probably something that every WordPress developer should be running regularly on every site they manage, probably with a CRON job that greps the output and emails you when it indicates a vulnerability.

nice database backup:
wp ai1wm backup --exclude-media --exclude-themes --exclude-inactive-themes --exclude-muplugins --exclude-plugins --exclude-inactive-plugins --exclude-cache
delete inactive plugins
wp plugin delete $(wp plugin list --status=inactive --field=name)

wp ai1wm backup --exclude-inactive-themes  --exclude-cache

Do a backup
Install the plu
wp plugin install all-in-one-wp-migration --activate

You must reload the page once before continuing

Do the backup
Adjust the settings for your own need, this here makes a backup of the database only. I suggest using rsync to sync media files.

wp ai1wm backup --exclude-media --exclude-themes --exclude-inactive-themes --exclude-muplugins --exclude-plugins --exclude-inactive-plugins --exclude-cache

Remove the plugin
wp plugin deactivate all-in-one-wp-migration --uninstall
wp plugin deactivate wonderplugin-lightbox-trial --uninstall
wp plugin deactivate wonderplugin-pdf-embed  --uninstall

Restore a backup
Go to backup directory or create if does not exist
cd wp-content/ai1wm-backups/

Download the backup
wget http://siteurl.fi/wp-content/ai1wm-backups/backup-20180105-142530-313.wpress

Install the plugin
wp plugin install all-in-one-wp-migration --activate

You must reload the page once before continuing

Restore the site from backup
wp ai1wm restore backup-20180105-142530-313.wpress

Not sure if necessary to flush permalinks twice, like when restoring from front end, but do it once or twice if you encounter problems.

wp rewrite flush

Remove the plugin and delete the backup file
wp plugin deactivate all-in-one-wp-migration --uninstall

rm backup-20180105-142530-313.wpress

Remember to remove the unneeded backup files from the source as well

Useful WP-CLI Commands with Examples
Commands always start with wp followed by a command and subcommand, followed by required and optional parameters.

Note that WP-CLI will work with the WordPress installation you are currently in the terminal. If you switch directories to go to another WordPress installation, it will work with that one.

Now we’ll take a look at some useful WP-CLI commands with examples.

wp plugin
Manages plugins, including installs, activations, and updates.

Installing multiple plugins
To install multiple plugins here’s an example that downloads and activates 3 plugins:

# Install multiple plugins
wp plugin install really-simple-ssl jetpack ninja-forms --activate
e.g: https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/

Updating a plugin:
To update a plugin here’s an example that downloads the new version and updates a plugin:

update ALL PLUGINS  
wp plugin update --all

# Update plugin
wp plugin update "plugin-name"
Activate, deactivate and delete a plugin:
# Activate plugin
$ wp plugin activate hello


# Deactivate plugin
$ wp plugin deactivate hello
Plugin 'hello' deactivated.
Success: Deactivated 1 of 1 plugins.

# Delete plugin
$ wp plugin delete hello
Deleted 'hello' plugin.
Success: Deleted 1 of 1 plugins.

Get a list of plugins:
wp plugin list
For example if you want to see only a list of all active plugins which have updates available, you can use:

wp plugin list --field=name --status=active --update=available
wp option
Get site URL
# Get site URL.
wp option get siteurl

# Set site URL
wp option set siteurl
wp search-replace
This is a useful command that searches/replaces strings in the database. e.g.: replacing and old domain name with a new domain name.

Before running this command we strongly recommend you to do a backup for your database, using the following command line:

wp db export
Once you’ve ensured that you have a backup for the database you can safely use the wp search-replace  command:
==============
wp search-replace 'http:' 'https:' --precise --recurse-objects --all-tables-with-prefix
wp search-replace 'http://gplpartnership.com/' 'http://www.storystudiochicago.org/' --precise --recurse-objects --all-tables-with-prefix

# Available roles:

administrator
editor
author
contributor
subscriber
wp core
Check for missing or modified core files
If you want to check if there are missing or modified core WordPress files you can use:
wp core verify-checksums
Reinstall WordPress Core
You can reinstall WordPress core using WP-CLI. The following command would download WordPress core without the default themes and plugins.
wp core download --skip-content --force

wp cache
Flush cache
WP-CLI  has the option to flush the default cache. You can rely on this option in case your website cache is not handled with the help of a caching plugin. To flush the cache, use the following command in your terminal:
# Flush cache
wp cache flush
===================
IMPORTING WORDPRESS WXR (.XML) FILES
To perform a simple import of your file, just use the following command:

wp import my-file.xml
MODIFYING AUTHOR BEHAVIOR
When importing a WXR file, you might have a situation where the post author in the export file doesn't exist on the site that it's being imported into. In that case, you can use the --authors option to define how to proceed with the import.

Creating Non-Existent Authors
If you want to create any authors that don't already exist, set value of the --authors option to create like this:

wp import my-file.xml --authors=create
Skipping Non-Existent Authors
If you'd like to just leave the post's author empty if the user doesn't already exist, you can set the value of the --authors option to skip:

wp import my-file.xml --authors=skip
Custom Mapping Authors
What if you want to associate your authors from the exported site with different users on the new site? WP-CLI allows for a custom CSV file to be provided. The CSV should be formatted as 2 columns with old_user_login and new_user_login as column headers like this:

old_user_login	new_user_login
user1	newuser1
anotheruser	somethingelse
To use the custom user mapping that you've defined within the CSV, just define the path within the --authors option like this:

wp import my-file.xml --authors=my_file.csv
SKIPPING CONTENT TYPES
When performing an import of your WXR file, you also have the option to skip certain types of data, such as attachments or thumbnail generation.

Skipping Attachment Imports
If you don't want to import any of the attachments that are listed inside the WXR file, you can use the --skip option with the attachment data type like this:

wp import my-file.xml --skip=attachment
Skipping Thumbnail Generation
What is you still want to import your post attachments but don't want to generate new thumbnails when the import occurs? Just use the --skip option with image_resize as the value like this:

wp import my-file.csv --skip=image_resize


====================================
BULK IMPORT IMAGES
It’s not unusual for a client to provide a set of images and ask you to import them into their website. Doing that through the administrator’s panel is painful. Instead, using the media tool of WP-CLI, you can complete this task in a single command:

wp media import images_folder/*

wp core plugin manager

Use the WP-CLI
You can install and activate your plugins using the WordPress CLI.

wp wpcore install --key=12345

Options

--force=yes
Overwrite existing plugins if installed

--activate=yes
Activate the plugins

--network=yes
Network activate all

========================
REGENERATING ALL THUMBNAILS
To regenerate all thumbnails for all images inside your WordPress media library, you can use the following command:

wp media regenerate --yes
Once the command is run, all thumbnails for all images will be regenerated. Of course, if you have a large number of images inside your media library, it might take some extra time to run through them all.

REGENERATING MISSING THUMBNAILS
What if you updated your theme to add an additional image size but don't want to regenerate the thumbnails that already exist? You can regenerate thumbnails for only the missing image sizes using the --only-missing option like this:

wp media regenerate --only-missing
REGENERATING THUMBNAILS FOR SPECIFIC IMAGES
If you want to regenerate thumbnails for a specific image, you can specify it by including the attachment ID after the command like this:

wp media regenerate 123
To regenerate thumbnails for multiple specified attachment IDs, just add them to the command like the following example:

wp media regenerate 123 456 789
KEEPING OLD THUMBNAIL SIZES
When regenerating your WordPress media library image thumbnails, the default behavior is to delete the old thumbnails. If you want to keep them, you can use the --skip-delete option:

wp media regenerate --skip-delete
REGENERATING SPECIFIC THUMBNAIL SIZES
In addition to being able to specify a specific image to regenerate thumbnails for, you can also define a specific thumbnail size to regenerate. To regenerate a specific size, use the --image_size option with the name of your thumbnail size as the value like in the following example:

wp media regenerate --image_size=large


wp media regenerate --yes
=======================
delete spam comments
wp comment delete --force $(wp comment list --status=spam --format=ids) [--force]

transients

wp transient delete --expired

delete trash
wp post delete $(wp post list --post_status=trash --format=ids) --force --defer-term-counting 

wp post delete --force $(wp post list --post_status=draft --format=ids)

Delete Posts With Revisions
If you did want to delete all post revision, then you can run this command;

wp post delete --force $(wp post list --post_type='revision' --format=ids)

======================================
testArray = array_merge($testArray, $referenceTable['val2']);
    var_dump($testArray);

$testArray = array_merge($testArray, (array)$referenceTable['val2']);


Deleting Empty WordPress Post Titles and Content Combinations
Back up the database first before you actually delete anything!

wp db export before-empty-post-clean.sql --all-tablespaces --allow-root


Empty Post Title
This WP-CLI command deletes the posts with empty titles and their associated postmeta, the --force flag deletes them permanently by skipping the trash. The tr command is used to replace any new lines with spaces to keep the formatting that WP-CLI requires.

wp post delete $(wp db query "SELECT ID FROM $(wp db prefix --allow-root)posts WHERE post_title=''" --allow-root | tr '\r\n' ' ') --force --allow-root

Empty Post Content
Here is a similar command but only targets the deletion of posts with empty post content

wp post delete $(wp db query "SELECT ID FROM $(wp db prefix --allow-root)posts WHERE post_content=''" --allow-root | tr '\r\n' ' ') --force --allow-root

Empty Post Title and Content
Finally this command will delete the posts that have an empty title and content

wp post delete $(wp db query "SELECT ID FROM $(wp db prefix --allow-root)posts WHERE post_content='' AND post_title=''" --allow-root | tr '\r\n' ' ') --force --allow-root

This will not delete associated postmeta but is faster since it is interacting with the database directly, could leave orphaned postmeta data leftover!



Empty Custom Post Types
Last example is for deleting those empty WooCommerce products

wp post delete $(wp db query "SELECT ID FROM $(wp db prefix --allow-root)posts WHERE post_type='product' AND post_content=''"  --allow-root | tr '\r\n' ' ') --force --defer-term-counting --allow-root


Empty Post Title and Content for Custom Post Types
We can do the same thing for Custom Post Types by adding a post_type parameter, here we are looking for WooCommerce products so the post_type column has been set to product

wp db query "SELECT ID FROM $(wp db prefix --allow-root)posts WHERE post_type='product' AND post_content='' AND post_title=''" --allow-root

wp db export

Now you have a backup of your database in an .SQL file at the root of your website.

WordPress File System Backup
Copying files from the server is not available in WP-CLI, but you can quickly compress all of your files, including the recent .SQL backup of your database.

Make sure you are in the root of your website, as we described earlier. Using the tar command with a few special parameters that make the backup better, and the trailing period at the end is very important, it ensures the new compressed file is saved in the same directory (i.e., folder).

"tar -vczf yourbackupfilename.gz ."

DISPLAYING ALL CRON EVENTS
To display a list of all cron events currently scheduled on your WordPress site, use the following command from within your site's root directory:

wp cron event list
RUNNING ALL WORDPRESS CRON EVENTS
If you want to trigger all currently due cron events (events that are due but haven't been run yet), you can run them with the following command:

wp cron event run --due-now
MANUALLY RUNNING A SCHEDULED CRON EVENT
To run all WordPress scheduled events manually, regardless of if they are due or not, you can use the following WP-CLI command:

wp cron event run --all
SCHEDULING A NEW CRON EVENT
Additional WP-Cron events can also be scheduled using WP-CLI. New cron events can be scheduled for any action hook within your site.

Scheduling a New Event for the Next Cron Run
The following command will schedule a new cron event for the desired action hook. This event will be triggered on the next time that the cron is run.

Be sure to replace my_example_action with the name of the action hook that you want to execute.

wp cron event schedule my_example_action
Scheduling a New Event for a Specific Date/Time
Scheduling a WordPress cron event to run on a specific date and time is similar to the example in the previous section, but requires an additional parameter that includes the date and time that the event should run.

wp cron event schedule my_example_action '+1 hour'
As you can see from the example above, a new event will be scheduled to run my_example_action in 1 hour.

Since the time parameter allows for any string that can use converted to a timestamp with the PHP strtotime() function, the following examples would also be valid:

Example: Run the Event on a Specific Date

wp cron event schedule my_example_action '7 July 2019'
Example: Run the Event in 1 Week

wp cron event schedule my_example_action '+1 week'
Example: Run the Event Next Monday

wp cron event schedule my_example_action 'next Monday'
For more information on the available formats, see the official PHP documentation on supported date and time formats.

Scheduling a New Recurring Cron Event
To create a new WordPress cron event that will repeat after a designated interval, you'll simply pass another argument containing how often the event will be run:

wp cron event schedule my_example_action now daily
In this example, we're using a WP-CLI command to tell WordPress to run my_example_action now and to run again once per day.

The available intervals are based on any currently defined cron intervals. By default, WordPress contains the following interval names:

hourly: Runs the event once per hour.
twicedaily: Runs the event twice per day (every 12 hours).
daily: Runs the event once per day (every 24 hours).
If you need additional cron intervals, you can add them using the cron_schedules filter within your plugin or theme.

DELETING A SCHEDULED CRON EVENT
Deleting a scheduled cron event with WP-CLI is quite straightforward. To delete an existing event, run the following command, replacing my_example_action with the name of your event action hook:

wp cron event delete my_example_action

search 

By default, the standard database search command will only search for tables that are registered with $wpdb. In most cases, this is perfectly fine since it will include any standard WordPress core tables, as well as tables used by plugins and themes (as long as they're being properly registered).

wp db search 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'
Optional: Search All Database Tables
Optionally, you can include all tables within the database, regardless of if they're properly prefixed or registered using $wpdb:

wp db search 'my search string' --all-tables
SEARCHING THROUGH SPECIFIC TABLES
Do you already know what table to search in? You can specify them when running the command by passing them after your search string like this:

wp db search 'my search string' wp_posts
Or to specify multiple tables:

wp db search 'my search string' wp_posts wp_comments
SEARCHING WITH REGEX (REGUL
AR EXPRESSIONS)
When searching for values that match a particular pattern, WP-CLI can be an incredibly handy too. Simply use regex within your database search query (without any flags) like this:

wp db search '^wp.*' --regex
If you want to pass additional regex flags within your database search, you can do so by using the --regex-flags parameter. For example, if you wanted to perform the same search as case-insensitive, it would look like this:

wp db search '^wp.*' --regex --regex-flags=i
